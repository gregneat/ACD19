# ACD19


This repository will evolve to the final ACD19 for this school year.

For now, include all files (.bat, .java, .class).  Near the start of school,
you can remove the .java files.

I see your commits to ACD repository and it looks really good.

Can you put all of that stuff ("Primitive Master Sub....'s") into this folder and conform to my binary numbering
system.  I know this is a pain in the ass, but it will really help me.  If you
guys can figure out how to auto-re-number in windows, that would be great (extra credit!).

Also, can you add your nice notes from the readme in the "Primitive Master Sub....'s" repository 
to this readme once the labs are renumbered.

Also, also, track the commits on "ACD labs & solutions".  If I do something new there, reflect the changes in
ACD19.

txt me if you have any questions.

Thx, great work!
