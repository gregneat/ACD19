# ACD Labs and Solutions


This repository is for you guys (Edan, Dylan and Ricky) to see what I am thinking for the flow of
the labs.  I have been building this since we had our initial meeting at the end of school last spring.  In each
folder, I have a readme file that BRIEFLY explains what the purpose of the lab is and a list of
API's or other references that may help the students to do the respective labs.  And I am sure its
full of errors, mis-spellings,...

I have taken the stuff I have collected from you guys and used it to help shape this list.  This has
really helped me a lot...Thank You!

Also there is a sub folder in each lab folder that has my code to solve that particular lab.  I did
this so I would make sure I didn't overlook a topic when we go from one step to the next.  But my labs
are ghetto.  The 
work you guys are doing is way better.  For example the Ricky lab with zillions of Cars and a Road
class is way cool.  I want the final ACD (which isn't this repository) to have an output for each lab (just the .class files) so
the students can see what their lab output should do.  No .java files will be included since that is their
job.  I want you guys to make all of those .class files.  In other words, the final ACD will have 
the outputs from YOUR solutions to all of the labs.

I don't care how you do the labs.  Edan is good crazy into jFrames and jPanels...and that is great.  
Dylan found another option altogether (Process).  And I have been using another simple Java graphics
library (sort of like a objectDraw wanna be).  It's all good.  I just want the lab outputs from however
you do it.  Dylan I believe is more or less working on his own.  Edan and Ricky I trust can negotiate
who does what from the lab list.  A whole bunch of the labs you guys have already done.  So gathering the
outputs is just housekeeping.

I will set up another repository for all of your lab outputs.  Dylan will have his own and Ricky and Edan will have one.

I envision that the final ACD will be updated a lot this year.  That is one of the reasons I am using gitHub.  So
students will get the curriculum from gitHub as opposed to my website.  And you guys will be making updates as
we find bugs, make additions, deletions...

One thing I haven't figured out is how to have a numbering system that will allow insertions automatically.  So if we
decide we need another lab, we can just insert it and all of the lab numbers will adjust.  If anyone knows how to do
that with gitHub, let me know.

Thx for your efforts!  I am really excited about the new ACD!!!

Oh yeah, don't push to this repository.  Only use it for pulling (or reading).  Until I set up the next repositories, just
keep using ACD if you want to show something.
